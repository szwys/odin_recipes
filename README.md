# odin_recipes

This project is about recipes, especially italian cuisine which is my favorite. It includes recipes of spaghetti, lasagna and pizza with pictures.

From my perspective it was pretty easy project. As I started I thought git would be a pain on the neck, but I was wrong. Overall it was very fun project to work on and look forward to do more frontend stuff.
